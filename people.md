## **Alumni**

### Huige Jiang, B.S.
Huige Jiang graduated from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and is currently pursuing a MSPH degree in Biostatistics. She started working in the Wingo lab in May 2019. Her current project is to simulate TMT proteomics data and test the performance of 2 quality control pipelines.

### Melissa Armendariz, B.S.
Ms. Armendariz Ms. Armendariz graduated from Virginia Tech with a B.S. in Biochemistry and a minor in Chemistry and Psychology. She was a research coordinator for the Wingo lab from 2016-2019. She left to work for a private company in Georgia.


### Alex Kotlar, Ph.D.
Dr. Kotlar received his Ph.D. in Genetics at Emory University in 2018 where
he was guided by Dr. Wingo in the development of online services (e.g.,
[https://bystro.io](https://bystro.io)) that assisted researchers in analyzing
terabytes of genomic data, decreasing analysis times by an order of magnitude.
He briefly joined the Wingo Lab as a postdoctoral fellow working on next-generation
online proteomics services. He is currently a [postdoctoral fellow](http://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/people/1144/)
at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT.

### Brittney Innocente, B.A.
Ms. Innocente was a research coordinator in 2015-2016 who led Dr. Aliza
Wingo's Genome-wide Association Study of Resilience until its completion
in 2016.

### Eleanor A. Sharp, M.D., M.S.
As an undergraduate student at University of Georgia, Ms. Sharp examined patterns of Inheritance among families with Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease with Dr. Wingo as a student in the 2012 [SURE program](http://college.emory.edu/undergraduate-research/index.html). She went on to obtain her medical and masters degree from Virginia School of Medicine and is now a pediatric resident at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

### Stephanie Stennett, M.A.
Ms. Stennett was a research coordinator from 2012-2013 who led Dr. Aliza
Wingo's Genome-wide Association Study of Resilience before she moved to
Texas to work for a private company.

### Zoe White, B.S.
Ms. White was a senior research technician from 2012-2017. She performed
targeted capture and next-generation sequencing experiments to identify
new genetic causes of Alzheimer's Disease.

### Maohua Xie, Ph.D.
Dr. Xie was a Bioinformatic Scientist from 2018-2019. He received his
Master Degree in Analytics at Georgia State University and Ph.D. in
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Wuhan University, China. His work
focused on proteogenomic approaches to identifing novel genetic variants
related to AD.

### Ha Eun Kong, B.S.
Ms. Kong was an M.D./Ph.D. student in [Genetics and Molecular Biology Graduate Program](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/GMB/index.html) co-mentored by Drs. Peng Jin and Thomas Wingo. The focus of her work was to identify new genetic modifiers of Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome and causes of Alzheimer's disease. Ms. Kong is currently completing her medical degree at Emory University.

### Wen Fan, MS.
Ms. Fan was a biostatistician from 2018-2019 who led the quality control efforts of brain proteomics data and analysis of large omics datasets generated by the Wingo Lab and our collaborators. She left the lab in 2019 to work for a private company in North Carolina.
