  <p>The <b>Wingo Lab</b> is a genetics laboratory at the
    <a href="http://www.cnd.emory.edu/">Emory Unversity's Center for
      Neurodegenerative Disease</a> and <a href="http://www.atlanta.va.gov/">
      Atlanta Veterans Administration</a> led by <b><a href="people/">
        Aliza Wingo, M.D., M.Sc.</a></b> and <b><a href="people/">
        Thomas Wingo, M.D.</a></b>. Our lab focuses on understanding the genetic
    basis of neurodegenerative disease (i.e., Alzheimer Disease) and psychological
    traits (i.e., psychological well-being, resilience, depression, post-traumatic
    stress disorder [PTSD]).</p>
