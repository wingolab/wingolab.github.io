She received her medical degree and residency training at Emory University School of Medicine. Subsequently, she completed a research fellowship, Master of Science in Clinical Research, and career development award under the mentorship of Kerry Ressler, MD, Ph.D. Dr. Wingo studies the genetic and molecular basis of depression, PTSD, as well as of psychological resilience and well-being. Additionally, Dr. Wingo investigates molecular mechanisms underlying the detrimental and protective effects of psychological factors on dementia risk. As an early-stage investigator, Dr. Wingo has received an American Psychiatric Association/Lilly Resident Research award, American Psychiatric Association Research Fellowship award, a NARSAD Young Investigator award, a VA Career Development Award, and recently six federal grants (R01, U01, Merit) to pursue her lines of research inquiries.

        description: Se Min (Minnie) Canon is the Wingo Lab Manager and Senior Research Specialist. She first joined the Wingo Lab as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Fall of 2012 while attending Emory College. During this time, she did a Senior Research Project on identifying genetic causes of an early-onset Alzheimer’s disease case in a family cohort from Colombia. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology from Emory University, she joined the lab full-time in 2014. Her work primarily involves nucleic acid extraction and quantification, DNA and miRNA library preparation for sequencing, and DNA genotyping and gene expressions. She manages and oversees research experiments and quality control.
